# AI & Cybersecurity Portfolio  
Welcome to my AI and cybersecurity project portfolio. This repository showcases projects in machine learning for spam detection, natural language processing for sentiment analysis, and a series of lab write‑ups covering hands‑on networking and server configuration exercises.  

## Projects Overview  

### AI Spam Detection  
This project implements an email spam detection system using machine learning. By preprocessing email data, extracting features such as the sender address, subject line, and message body, and applying algorithms like Naive Bayes or neural networks, the model classifies emails as spam or ham ([github.com](https://github.com/Apaulgithub/oibsip_taskno4)). It includes techniques like handling imbalanced datasets, text cleaning (stopword removal and punctuation stripping) and tokenization using TensorFlow ([www.geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/detecting-spam-emails-using-tensorflow-in-python/)).  

### Sentiment Analysis  
Sentiment analysis (opinion mining) classifies text into categories such as positive, negative or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) ([Sentiment Analysis Using Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/07/sentiment-analysis-using-python/)). This project explores multiple approaches, including TextBlob, VADER, bag‑of‑words models, and deep learning architectures (LSTM/transformers) ([www.analyticsvidhya.com](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/07/sentiment-analysis-using-python/)). The system processes text data from sources like product reviews or social media to gauge emotion and provide actionable insights.  

### Lab Write‑Ups  
The lab series documents hands‑on exercises with network and server technologies. The Cisco labs involve configuring router and switch settings—such as setting hostnames, password access, interface IP addressing, and saving configurations ([itexamanswers.net](https://itexamanswers.net/lab-11-5-1-basic-cisco-device-configuration-answers.html#:~:text=Scenario%20%20Task%201%3A%20Configure,Step%206%3A%20Configure%20the%20virtual)). Windows Server configurations cover tasks like network interface setup, domain joining, and group policy adjustments. Each lab write‑up explains the objective, step‑by‑step commands and provides example configurations.  

## Getting Started  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/PoseidonIntelligence/ai-cybersecurity-portfolio.git  
   ```  

2. **Environment setup**  
   - Python 3.8+ with libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `nltk`.  
   - For sentiment analysis, install `textblob` and `vaderSentiment`.  
   - For Cisco labs, you can use Packet Tracer or real devices; Windows Server labs require a Windows Server VM.  

3. **Run projects**  
   - Follow the README in each project subdirectory (`ai-spam-detection`, `sentiment-analysis`, `lab-writeups`) for detailed setup and execution instructions.
